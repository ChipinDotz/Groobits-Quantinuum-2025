#### **Project Title**: Quantum Simulation of Disease Spread Using Real-World Data

#### **Overview**
This project uses quantum computing techniques to simulate the spread of a disease (e.g., COVID-19) across different countries. It combines real-world datasets with a quantum circuit model to analyze infection and recovery dynamics over time.

The simulation leverages:
- **Real-world data**: Daily new cases of COVID-19 and population statistics for various countries.
- **Quantum circuits**: A qubit model to represent healthy and infected states.

By ensuring consistent data preprocessing and aligning all countries' timelines, this project provides insights into how disease dynamics evolve under varying conditions.
